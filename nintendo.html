          <h2>About Nintendo</h2>
          <h3>
            
Nintendo has been at the forefront of video game innovation for decades, shaping the way generations have played, interacted, and imagined. Originally a playing card company founded in 1889, Nintendo entered the video game industry in the 1970s, but it was the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the 1980s that truly revolutionized home gaming. The NES not only revived a collapsing gaming industry but introduced the world to now-iconic franchises like Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.<br><br>

Nintendo's passion for innovation continued with the release of the GameBoy, a portable gaming system that defined handheld gaming and brought hits like Tetris and Pokémon into players' pockets. They expanded this with the Nintendo DS, which added touch controls and dual screens, and later the 3DS, introducing glasses-free 3D gameplay. <br><br>

On the home console front, Nintendo consistently took creative risks. The Super Nintendo (SNES) brought enhanced graphics and storytelling. The Nintendo 64 introduced 3D worlds and the first analog stick, allowing players to explore games like Super Mario 64 and GoldenEye 007 with new freedom. The GameCube pushed visuals further and added multiplayer classics like Super Smash Bros. Melee.<br><br>

In 2006, the Wii changed everything with motion-sensing gameplay that welcomed casual gamers and families into the fold. Titles like Wii Sports became household staples. Then came the Nintendo Switch in 2017 — a hybrid console merging handheld and TV gaming into one seamless experience, giving players the flexibility to game anywhere.<br><br>
