        <h2>Why I Created This Site</h2>
        <p>
            As a passionate gamer and tech enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by how consoles evolved — from 8-bit classics to today’s ultra-realistic systems.
            I created ConsoleDNA to share that journey and highlight how each brand brought something unique to the gaming world.

        <h2>Made By</h2>
        <p>
            This website was created as part of a school computing project, where I combined design, research, and coding to build a visually engaging and informative experience.
            Every section was designed and coded by me, and I hope you enjoy exploring it.
